# LLM Revshare Economics Thesis

**Unbiased reasoning cannot be auctioned — it can only be monetised on success.**

This repository contains a **whitepaper** presenting a quantitative hypothesis for why **outcome-based revenue sharing (revshare)** is the only economically compatible business model for frontier LLMs at scale, using benchmarks from digital advertising, inference costs, and agent-mediated commerce unit economics.
