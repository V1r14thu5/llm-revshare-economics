## Executive Summary

For twenty years → the internet has monetised **attention** through advertising auctions.  
Google and Meta perfected engagement and bid optimisation, creating trillion-dollar platforms.  

But **LLMs monetise intent, not attention.**  
Their core value → lies in **stochastic, context-sensitive reasoning → over long interactions** that resolve real constraints and soft user preferences.

This paper hypothesises that:

> **Outcome-based revenue sharing (Revshare) is the only monetisation model compatible with frontier LLM reasoning at scale.**

### Supporting evidence:
- OpenAI annualised revenue by mid-2025: **USD 10–13B**, up from 2–4B in 2023–24  
- 2025 inference spend through Q3 2025 already: **USD 8.6B+**  
- Google 2025 Avg. CPC: **USD 5.26**, Avg CPL: **USD 70.11**, trending upward  
- Global 2025 advertising spend: **USD 1T+**, digital majority  
- Estimated gross profit per high-intent AI commerce session: **USD ~3.73**

### Key implications:
- PPC corrupts reasoning by injecting **bid-based bias**
- Revshare pays **only on real outcomes**, strengthening reasoning incentives
- Even small merchants can compete → as ranking shifts from capital to semantic fit

At scale of ~100M high-intent commercial sessions per month:

> **Annual gross profit opportunity ≈ USD 4.4–5B**, materially offsetting inference burn.

Final conclusion:

**Search monetises fragments of intent.  
LLMs monetise reasoning chains.  
Only revshare respects and scales with that difference.**

## Core Thesis Breakdown

### 1. Stochastic reasoning evaluates:
- Hard constraints (budget, delivery, dimensions, stock)
- Soft preferences (risk, style, trust, social proof)
- Implicit option ranking in embedding space

### 2. Ad auctions introduce:
- Bid-based option distortion
- Loss of user trust
- Noisy training signals
- Lower long-term conversion

### 3. Revshare introduces:
- Pay-on-success dynamics
- Incentives for better reasoning chains
- No upfront merchant cost
- Merit-based visibility
- Reinforcement-aligned optimisation

## Conclusion

Revshare transforms LLM reasoning from a **cost centre** to a **monetised economic substrate**.  
Over time → declining inference cost per session creates a **margin-expanding flywheel**.

> **The next era of the internet monetises outcomes → not attention.  
LLMs are the infrastructure of intent → not engagement.**
