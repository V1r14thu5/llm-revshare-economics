→ enough to materially hedge current inference burn.

Critically:

> Conversion collapses if reasoning quality is bad → making reasoning the asset, not the side-effect.

## 6. Fairness and Incentive Design

### 6.1. Allocation logic

| Model | Allocation |
|---|---|
| PPC | visibility via capital bidding |
| Revshare | income via semantic fit and reasoning success |

### 6.2. Small business advantage

Under PPC:

- Must bid against global brands at US$3–6 CPCs

Under revshare:

- Expose product data → compete by fit, reviews, stock, shipping
- **No upfront ad budget needed**
- Visibility becomes **merit-allocated, not capital-allocated**

### 6.3. Incentive for reasoning quality

Revshare optimises for:

- Clarification → not premature suggestion
- Fit → not bidder power
- Learning rewarded via reinforcement → linked to outcomes → not clicks
- Returns avoided → long-term satisfaction increased

Meaning:

> Stochastic reasoning becomes the **monetised flywheel — not the expense sink**.

## 7. OpenAI Burn → Economics of Intelligence CapEx

- Training runs ≈ CapEx on intelligence asset
- Inference = variable cost → unit price declining over time due to:
  - Hardware improvements
  - Software optimisation
  - Architectural efficiency

Thus:

> Revshare is a **margin-expanding economic call option on AI-mediated GMV**.

## 8. Forecast → From Ads to Agentic Marketplaces

### 8.1. Macro spend environment

- 2025 Global ad-spend ≈ US$1T+
- 2030 Pre-AI forecasts ≈ US$1.5T digital ads/marketing
- 2029 Entertainment/media ≈ US$3.5T

### 8.2. Expansion + substitution

- Agents compress funnels, generate new demand
- Agents unlock long-tail supply
- Even 5–10% capture of global e-commerce/services GMV → massive implied revenue pool
- 10–15% revshare at capture layer → rivals current PPC scale

Meaning:

> The discovery layer monetises reasoning and satisfaction → not bidder capital.

---

## 9. Final Conclusion

> **Search monetises intent fragments.  
LLMs monetise reasoning chains.  
The only sustainable monetisation layer for stochastic reasoning at scale is Revshare.**

Revshare:

- Reinforces reasoning quality
- Hedges inference burn
- Removes merchant capital requirement for visibility
- Scales without corrupting the LLM asset users trust most → the reasoning chain itself
